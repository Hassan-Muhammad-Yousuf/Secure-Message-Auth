# Secure-Message-Auth


## Generic

This repository shows important ideas in web application security by means of useful implementations. It addresses HMAC message authentication codes, safe JWT-based authentication, and SQL injection vulnerabilities with mitigating techniques.


## Materials

Task 1: SQL Injection through HTML Webpage <br>
Task 2: Authentication and Authorization via JWT <br>
Task 3: Message Authentication Codes <br>


## Task 1: HTML web page SQL injection

### Objectives

Show web application SQL injection weaknesses and their solutions.

### Tools

Frontend HTML; <br> 
backend PHP with MySQL; <br>
database MySQL <br>

### Utilisation

Using prepared statements, **Secure Version** safely interacts with MySQL.
Directly adds user input into SQL queries to show vulnerability in **Unsecure Version**.



# Task 2: JWT authentication and authorization

### Objectives

Create and put in use a safe JWT-based authentication system.

### Methods

Python's Flask backend framework depends on PyJWT.


# Task 3: Codes of Message Authentication

# Objectives

Use message authentication based on HMAC for commands-line programmes.

### Tools

Python.

### Execution

Contains HMAC computation and MD5 and SHA-512 hash techniques.
Describes MACs, HMAC design, and advantages for data integrity.
